## About
In May 2025, I graduated from Columbia with a degree in math and physics. In September 2025, I will begin the [math PhD program](https://mathematics.stanford.edu/academics/graduate-students/phd-program) at Stanford. 

## Math
I wrote my undergraduate thesis supervised by Professor Ivan Corwin on some Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality results for last passage percolation models. OpenAI's GPT-5 seems to have a lower hallucination rate and to be less of a sycophant than previous LLMs. As such, I have found it a useful companion in learning and writing math. When I type up notes, I often run sections of them through GPT-5. When I get the stamp of approval, I become more confident that the sections are free of typos or obvious technical errors. With this in mind, I built an [in-browser editor](gttps://www.jameshstephens.net/editor) that lets me write markdown and get GPT-5's opinion on my writing side-by-side.
