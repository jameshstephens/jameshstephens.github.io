## About
In May 2025, I graduated from Columbia with a degree in math and physics. In September 2025, I will begin the [math PhD program](https://mathematics.stanford.edu/academics/graduate-students/phd-program) at Stanford. 

## Math
I wrote my undergraduate thesis supervised by Professor Ivan Corwin on some Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality results for last passage percolation models.
